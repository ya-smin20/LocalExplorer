        The user has a set of preferred activities. The suggested activities should take into account those preferences but should **never repeat** any activities that were previously suggested.
        Suggest a set of fresh and personalized activities based on the following details:
        - Weather: {weather_data['weather'][0]['description']}
        - Temperature: {weather_data['main']['temp']}Â°C
        - Time of day: {time_of_day}

        Please provide:
        - 4 Indoor activities that can be done at home (ensure they are varied and **distinct** from prior suggestions).
        - 4 Outdoor activities suitable for the weather and time, utilizing nearby places with their coordinates and maps:
        {nearby_places}

        The activities should be categorized as follows:
        - **Indoor Activities:**
        List 4 indoor activities that are distinct from previous suggestions.

        - **Outdoor Activities:**
        For each outdoor activity:
        - Provide the name of the place.
        - A short description of the activity.
        - A Google Maps link to the location.

        Ensure the activities are fresh, diverse, and **never repeated**. Output the activities in the following format:

        **Indoor Activities:**
        - Activity: [Activity description]
        
        **Outdoor Activities:**
        - Activity: [Activity description]
